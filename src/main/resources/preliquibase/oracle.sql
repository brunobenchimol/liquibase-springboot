-- PreLiquibase
--    The following SQL gets executed prior to invoking Liquibase. 
--    It only gets executed if the database is Oracle.
--
--    In Oracle Database the concept of schema is tied to the concept of
--    a user. This means that in particular for Oracle you may want to
--    use another strategy for separating different environments. Therefore, 
--    the SQL statement below is not valid SQL and is designed to fail.
